### Running the project

If you're on VS Code, install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, and then click "Go Live". This will run the website locally. Usually this occurs on [127.0.0.1:5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500). This extension allows for the website to automatically reflect live changes to the code.

If you're not on VS Code, you can always just double-click the `index.html` to have it open in your default browser.
